# What is this?
Well, This is a very simple lyrics generator using a markov chain. The data is in `input`.txt
and it has the lyrics of a couple of songs from Linkin Park. Just run `python lyrics.py` to
get a lyric.

# Why you made it?
The day I wrote it, I had watched a Veritasium video in youtube about markov chain. and yeah,
The power went out and I was bored. So instead of waiting for electricity, I wrote this script
using my phone - yes a phone! - then sent it to my laptop and added more data to the dataset.
It was a very fun mini-project.

# Examples?
sure:
```
to the hands of disregard
handful of me
while i want me know
we're building take my turn
and all the undertow
i've become so far
but in the turn
caught in the time when
i tried so numb, i thought was never had to heal, i would be
has fallen apart my trust in the pressure to lose control
'cause in the surface
consuming 
this lack thing you on me, fall to the turn
waiting to take
i've felt so hard and got so numb, i fall
confusing what i've held me down
so when you see these scars
i am what i belong
crawling in the the day, the pressure to just caught in mind inside me know
we're building spite find something i've window
tryna hold on, d-didn't even matter
i'm tired of what is never feel
anything tried, to find myself until i so far
but in you
pushed as your unconfident
'cause you like ignored
time but negativity?
'cause all and wash away
what away there hard and to break it doesn't even though i can't feel the undertow
i've the end, it to burn it or not
right now, hear me back thing you for once just like you to just like uncertainty
so let mercy come and far as i take is real
crawling in mind, alone
and the end, it know why
it doesn't even
```

Sounds like mixed of biggest LP hit tracks - it actually is - but `i am what i belong` gives me some hope :)
